## 🌟 Project Overview
Welcome to **The Agentic Architect**, my public repository dedicated to deep-diving into the theory and implementation of **Large Language Model (LLM) Agents**.

This project serves as a structured self-study journal to master the concepts from foundational LLM principles through advanced agentic system design, covering key techniques like RAG, fine-tuning, and robust memory management.

## 📖 Repository Chapters

### 1. 01-Foundations: LLM, Agent, Agentic System
* **Introduction to LLMs:** A high-level overview of the Transformer architecture and pre-training.
* **What is an Agent?** Defining the core **Perceive-Plan-Act-Reflect** loop .
* **Agentic Systems:** Differentiation between single-agent tools and multi-agent teams.

### 2. 02-Techniques: Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Fine-Tuning
* #### **Prompt Engineering**
    * Notebooks and examples demonstrating **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** and the critical **Reason and Act (ReAct)** prompting patterns.
* #### **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
    * Code walkthroughs covering document loading, chunking, embedding, vector storage (using libraries like `ChromaDB`), and the final generation step. .
* #### **LLM Fine-Tuning**
    * Focus on efficient methods like **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for instruction tuning.

### 3. 03-Context & Memory Management
* Explorations into managing the agent's state: simple buffer memory vs. advanced semantic memory using vector stores (long-term memory).
